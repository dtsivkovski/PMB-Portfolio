# Challenge 2: Pass list1 into list2. However, list2 must contain the elements of list1 in order. Print list2. +0.3 if you can create a function to order a list and can display it on your website

# Challenge 3: Find a way to add 3 to each element in the array. Then, take the average of the array and put it into the variable avg. +0.2 if you can turn this into a function and display it on your website.

# PBL 1-2 Table of Contents
## Peer Review Grading
### PBL(Team): 
#### - [Scrum Board](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/projects/1): The scrum master has defined all tasks on the scrum board, designer has started creating a wire frame, and technical lead has helped coordinate a brain write where we discussed our animations 
#### - GitHub Assets: Navigators have started testing any new additions, developers have started work on dropdown menu (though integrating the code has been a challenge), and other developers have integrated Greet and Video Journal 0 functionality into a [mini-lab page](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/greet.html).
#### - [TPT Points](https://padlet.com/amv7668/5dauht31raq9w168) (see Group #6 on the Padlet): The group has created a visual proof-of-concept in the padlet during the TPT and explained the basic idea of the project.

### PBL(Individual): 
Each name has a link to their mini-lab page that will be completed in the future.
- [Daniel](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/daniel.html) 4/4 points individual, 4/4 points team - Here is my [starter page](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/daniel.html) as of right now. I have mainly been working on the mini-lab items and the organizational side of things (see the [github commits](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/commits/main) page for more detail). Here are my [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUWRIzZNDamJkkeBQQRPgkicyssI-7nxXZHEvshCFeU/edit?usp=sharing) for the collegeboard videos. Finally, my personal work/computer plan is to always bring and use my own laptop with all the proper utilities and tools installed.
- [Timmy](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/timmy.html) 4/4 points individual, 4/4 points team - Timmy has been mainly planning and envisioning the project. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S0I6ti23otpBITORbiepFlUCE-R13--DvuZkvMKTQ-Q/edit?usp=sharing) is timmy's concept and his description/idea for the project is written below the peer grading. Timmy's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oc-Rg6rpiqZmCAweALGtEej1AtrMTRSh12mURUh4pTE/edit?usp=sharing). 
- [Armaan](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/armaan.html) 4/4 points individual, 4/4 points team- Armaan has been working on the [navbar dropdown menu](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/layouts/navbar.html), here are armaan's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_E-37b3tbgJv0VcAcC7PU_7ytQ2aOs8SGIzu6B8oG5A/edit?usp=sharing). He has been very focused this week on attempting to get the dropdown menu to work.
- [Chris](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/chris.html) 4/4 points individual, 4/4 points team.- Chris has worked on getting [greet functionality](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/greet.html) to work on the mini-lab page. He has also organized [brain write](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19p4wA_jviMpx37dnjZIglBBraUFBfghGIdqMk1AFd0s/edit?usp=sharing) times, where we discussed our website so far and ideas for the future. Here are Chris's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4gal5lYJBBr_z2azGztMHgP4tvW4NGm25VmLYnUVMY/edit?usp=sharing).


### Project Ideation
Form a website that generates a random animal picture on command. Then which you can share through various methods, or learn more about an animal of your choosing.

-----
### Idea
Starter code should be fun and practical.
### Visual thoughts
#### Organize with Bootstrap menu 
#### Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
#### Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, Youtube
#### Show project specific links (hrefs) per page

### Implementation progress (August 13th, 2021)
#### Project entry point is main.py, this enables Flask Web App and provides capability to renders templates (HTML files)
#### The main.py is the  Web Server Gateway Interface, essentially it contains a HTTP route and HTML file relationship.  The Python code constructs WSGI relationships for index, kangaroos, walruses, and hawkers.
#### The project structure contains many directories and files.  The template directory (containing html files) and static directory (containing js files) are common standards for HTML coding.  Static files can be pictures and videos, in this project they are mostly javascript backgrounds.
#### WSGI templates: index.html, kangaroos.html, ... are aligned with routes in main.py.
#### Other templates support WSGI templates.  The base.html template contains common Head, Style, Body, Script definitions.  WSGI templates often "include" or "extend" these templates.  This is a way to reuse code.
#### The VANTA javascript statics (backgrounds) are shown and defaulted in base.html (birds), but are block replaced as needed in other templates (solar, net, ...)
#### The Bootstrap Navbar code is in navbar.html. The base.html code includes navbar.html.  The WSGI html files extend base.html files.  This is a process of management and correlation to optimize code management.  For instance, if the menu changes discovery of navbar.html is easy, one change reflects on all WSGI html files. 
#### Jinja2 variables usage is to isolate data and allow redefinitions of attributes in templates.  Observe "{% set variable = %}" syntax for definition and "{{ variable }}" for reference.
#### The base.html uses combination of Bootstrap grid styling and custom CSS styling.  Grid styling in observe with the "<Col-3>" markers.  A Bootstrap Grid has a width of 12, thus four "Col-3" markers could fit on a Grid row.
#### A key purpose of this project is to embed links to other content.  The "href=" definition embeds hyperlinks into the rendered HTML.  The base.html file shows usage of "href={{github}}", the "{{github}}" is a Jinja2 variable.  Jinja2 variables are pre-processed by Python, a variable swap with value, before being sent to the browser.

### IDE management (things that happened beyond plan)
#### Recall on ".gitignore" solution to the pains of temporary files.  Start a ".gitignore" and avoid promoting temporary files to Git, for instance IDE xml files.
#### A project needs to establish a "requirements.txt" to keep track of Python packages used by the project.  This help in other IDEs and Deployment.  IntelliJ has menu Tool -> Sync Python Requirements to start file.
